The specific tasks will vary depending on the company and project.\\n\\nSalary information is inconsistent across sources and locations.  One source indicates an average salary for GenAI professionals in the US ranging from $148,045 to $1,000,000 per year, with higher earners often in the San Francisco Bay Area and working for major tech companies. Another source cites an average of $115,864 per year for Generative AI Engineers in the US.  It's important to note that these are averages and actual salaries can vary significantly based on experience, location, company size, and specific skills.  Salaries in other countries will likely be different.  More specific salary information requires a more targeted search, specifying location and experience level.\""

Are you interested in:\\n\\n* **American Football:**  A high-impact, strategic game with running, passing, and tackling.  Known for its physicality, complex plays, and passionate fan base.  If this is what you mean, I can tell you about the NFL, college football, different positions, strategies, and even some great games to watch.\\n\\n* **Soccer (Association Football):** The world\\'s most popular sport!  A fast-paced, global game emphasizing teamwork, skill, and precision passing.  I can discuss the major leagues (like the Premier League, La Liga, etc.), famous players, tactical formations, and the beautiful game\\'s rich history.\\n\\n* **Rugby (Union or League):**  A physically demanding sport with a strong emphasis on running with the ball, tackling, and kicking.  Rugby Union is known for its more open play, while Rugby League is faster and more focused on scoring tries.  I can explain the rules, key positions, and the passionate rivalries within each code.\\n\\n* **Australian Rules Football (AFL):** A unique and fast-paced sport played with an oval ball, combining elements of soccer, basketball, and rugby.  I can tell you about its distinctive rules, the high level of athleticism required, and the passionate following in Australia.\\n\\n* **Gaelic Football:**  Another fast-paced, high-scoring sport played with a round ball, popular in Ireland.  It combines elements of soccer, hurling, and rugby.  I can explain its unique rules and the intense rivalries between counties.\\n\\n\\nTell me which type of football you\\'re interested in, and I\\'ll give you a comprehensive guide!\\n'"
